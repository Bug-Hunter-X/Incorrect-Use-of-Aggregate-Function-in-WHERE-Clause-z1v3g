This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries: the incorrect use of aggregate functions within the WHERE clause.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  Aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), etc., should be used with GROUP BY or in a HAVING clause, not the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause filters individual rows before aggregation, while aggregate functions operate on groups of rows.
